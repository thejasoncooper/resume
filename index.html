						<h3 class="text-warning">Career Summary</h3>
						<p>I've always had an affinity for and a knack for technology. As I've grown through my career, I realized how important it is to me that I use the technology and soft skills I've developed to create (websites, apps, media, content) and provide services to institutions that are dedicated to improving people's lives.</p>
						<p>More simply put: I want to work on interesting projects that can tangibly help people.</p>
						<p>Much of my experience comes from the nonprofit KABOOM! where I consistently wore multiple engineering, marketing, and communications hats across a number of atypical-for-nonprofit roles, including <strong>Product and Content Manager</strong>, <strong>Quality Assurance Coordinator</strong>, and finally, <strong>Digital and Creative Services Director</strong>.</p>
						<p>You can read more about what made KABOOM! such a dynamic, technology-driven, and forward-thinking leader in the nonprofit space in the <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/KaBOOM/wWul9DxKfQEC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=0" target="_blank" rel="noindex,nofollow"> founder's book</a>, but during my 14+ years with the organization, I learned every lesson, felt every emotion you could imagine in a work space &mdash; from the thrill of launching a new web application to the disappointment when it's time to shut the application down. From watching the sheer joy on a kid's face when a playground is built for them, all the way through the growing pains of becoming a more equitable organization, inside and out.</p>
						<p>I started at KABOOM! as a community manager for the KABOOM! online community of playground builders and play advocates. That led me to take on a data analyst role to discover what was working and what wasn't in our online community and website. It also led me to launching KABOOM! across the burgeoning social media sites as Myspace, Twitter, and Facebook began their rise to national relevance. I stepped away from content and social media to focus on our community products, becoming a product manager for our mission-driven apps: the Map of Play, Our Dream Playground, and home-grown, custom-built CMS that powered kaboom.org. At that point, I was the website's content editor, information architect, webmaster, analyst, and co-lead on the design and UX for kaboom.org.</p>
						<p>Late in my KABOOM! tenure I added "creative director" to my responsibilities. There I led creative operations, budgeting and planning photo/video shoots and events, overseeing the KABOOM! design system for print and digital operations, and was a supervising producer and editor for KABOOM! video productions.</p>
						<p>My proudest outcome of my time working in the creative arm of KABOOM! was supervising the production of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq3nRWIQook" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>From Piece to Peace: The Pullman Playground Story</em></a>, a short documentary featuring a community that came together to stop the violence and build an amazing place to play for its kids.</p>
						<p>In between those highlights, I was managing (or doing the job of) others performing KABOOM! social media, email marketing, SEM, SEO, SMM, technology consultation, and performance analysis across all the digital channels. And sometimes I just helped people with their PowerPoints or Excel pivot tables.</p>
						<p>Before KABOOM! I was a digital communication coordinator at Defenders of Wildlife. Earlier than that, I cleaned, "prepped", and ported cargo and 15-passanger vans for Enterprise Rent-a-Car while simultaneously going to school to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science.</p>
